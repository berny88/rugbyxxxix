    <h2 class="lead">Principles : </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Entering bets up to 2 hours before the start of matches</li>
      <li>At the end of each match, results are recorded by the administrator and each participant's points are calculated and ranked.</li>
      <li>The spirit of the calculation of the points is to leave a "certain" part to the random to leave all its chances to each one, connaisseur or not</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="lead">Community: a group of players who want to bet together</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each player can bet in one "community"; in other words, a bettor can bet in several communities.</li>
      <li>Rankings will take place by community</li>
      <li>Each community leader will be responsible for commenting on each game day for their community.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="jumbotron rule_jumbo_2">
    <h2 class="lead">Calculation of points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If the bettor has found the winner (or guessed a draw): +5 points.</li>
      <li>+3 points if the bettor has guessed the number of points of a team.</li>
      <li>+3 points if the bettor guessed the good difference of points between the 2 teams (no matter the winner).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or +2 points if the bettor has guessed a difference of points (between his bet and the match) between 1 (incl) and 5 points (incl).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or +1 point if the bettor has guessed a difference of points (between his bet and the match) between 6 (incl) and 10 points (incl).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Therefore, for each match, a bettor can collect 5 + (3 + 3) + 3 points = 14 points if he guesses the exact result of the match.</li>
      <!--<li style="color:red;">Achtung : for the final phase, the score <b> at the end of extra time </b> (if any) will be taken into account (penalties are not counted). There may therefore be draws.</li>-->
      <li>Example: TeamA vs TeamB : 12 - 5
        <ul>
          <li>Bet : 12 - 5 => 14 pts (5 + 3 + 3 + 3) won</li>
          <li>Bet : 5 - 12 => 3 pts won</li>
          <li>Bet : 12 - 10 => 10 pts (5 + 3 + 2) won</li>
          <li>Bet : 12 - 6 => 9 pts (5 + 3 + 1) won</li>
          <li>Bet : 12 - 0 => 8 pts (5 + 3) won</li>
          <li>Bet : 10 - 0 => 6 pts (5 + 1) won</li>
          <li>Bet : 11 - 4 => 8 pts (5 + 3) won</li>
        </ul>
